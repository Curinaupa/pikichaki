/**
 * Add to project  “MyShapes” a new  interface called “Drawable”, with abstract method draw().
 The draw() method has no arguments and does not return a value.
 Implement  interface Drawable to class Shape.
 The classes that implements the Drawable interface will provide actual implementation to these abstract
 method witch print characteristics of each shape on console (print to console information about this object
 from toString() and area of this shape (using “calcArea()” method).
 Add code to main() method in class MainLab141 to iterate over shapes array in loop (use for-each loop) and
 invoke draw() method.
 Execute the program, output must looks like:

 This is Rectangle, color: RED, width=11, height=22,  area is: 242
 This is Triangle, color: BLACK, a=5, b=5, c=5, area is: 10.825
 This is Circle, color: GREEN, radius=10, area is: 314.15926
