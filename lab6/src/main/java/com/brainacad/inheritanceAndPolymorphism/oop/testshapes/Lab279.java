/**
 * Add to project  “MyShapes” a new class “Triangle” which is a subclass of Shape.
 Add to class Triangle a private field’s a, b, c (of double type) which is sides of triangle.
 In class Triangle override  calcArea() method which must return area of triangle
 (By the formula:  area  = Vs(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)   , where s=(a+b+c)/2  ).
 In class Triangle override the toString() method. It must return string which contain name of shape,
 color and a, b, c sides of triangle. Example:
 “This is Triangle, color: BLACK, a=5, b=5, c=5”
 Add to class Triangle constructor with color, a, b and c arguments.

 Then add to class MainLab141 code to create one Triangle object and print it name, color, a, b, c sides of triangle
 to console. Then invoke calcArea() method and print result to console.
 Program output must looks like:
 “This is Triangle, color: BLACK, a=5, b=5, c=5”
 “Shape area is: 10.825”
