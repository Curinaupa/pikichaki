/**
 * Add to project  “MyShapes” a new class “Circle” which is a subclass of Shape.
 Add to class Circle a private field “radius” (of double type).
 In class Circle override  calcArea() method which must return area of circle
 (by the formula:  area  = PI*radius2).
 In class Circle override the toString() method. It must return string which contain name
 of shape, color and radius of circle. Example:
 “This is Circle, color: GREEN, radius=22”
 Add to class Circle constructor with color and radius arguments.

 Then add to class MainLab141 code to create one Circle object and print it name color, and radius
 to console. Then invoke calcArea() method and print result to console.
 Program output must looks like:
 “This is Circle, color: GREEN, radius=10”
 “Shape area is: 314.15926”
